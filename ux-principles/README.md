After reviewing the theoretical design description, some UX issues could be identified.

1. The contrast of the colors complicate the reading of the information on each of the pages.
2. The font size is not consistent throughout the app.
3. The interaction with the posts is not intuitive for the user. The 'Like' and 'Comment' buttons do not have an inviting design.

I propose the following points to correct the mentioned problems.

1. Apply rules based on color theory, such as the 60-30-10 rule, taking into account the harmony by means of the chromatic circle.
2. Maintain consistency in font size, establishing a default standard for titles and content in general. In this way the user will not have to wonder whether or not the same words in different contexts mean the same thing.
3. Implement the use of icons for the 'Like' and 'Comment' buttons in each of the posts to motivate the user to interact with them. An intuitive but minimalist design is the main intention. This way the user stays focused on the post, but immediately has the possibility to interact with it.

Nielsen heuristics are an excellent starting point for improving and maintaining good ux within the application. Concepts such as 'minimalist design' and 'consistency', mentioned in the previous points, are some of the ones that Jakob Nielsen encourages to take into account when designing.
